Born in India, just like most people around him, Puneet loved cinema. 
Following his dream of making his own film, he wrote his first screenplay in 2015 during his post doctoral research at the University hospital, 
Cologne where CRISPR was just being introduced as a technique in lab.  
In 2018 he finally got the opportunity to direct this no-budget project which completed in February 2019.  
Puneet has a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and 
is currently working as a Production Assistant in Cologne, Germany.

Quit my Job in the Oil business to make movies.
Started as a lighting trainee with a daily series production and worked
my way up to be a gaffer.
Worked on a couple of short movies including 'EVA - A CRISPR Story'
which was a great experience with great people.
